AGENTS GUIDE — TEMPLATE MANAGER

- The `template/` folder stores the base files used to seed new working repos.
- Do not edit anything under `template/` unless a human explicitly approves the change.
- Make edits only after copying the template into a target repo; treat this repo as read-only scaffolding.
